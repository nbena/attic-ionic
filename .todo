modify package.json
add a badge to each tag in order to see the referenced note.
ion-chip for the link in the notes, when pressed, option to delete or modify.
the select documentation tell me how to have different already selected option.


create two array
one is full
the other is displayed
always work on the displayable. When searchbar is empty, refill.

improve update after something.

ok update text.

change var name on notes.ts, should use shownNotes and allNotes.

done.

test the new tags page.

db:
notes, tags
all operations are directly send to the DB:
on update cascade? no, because the _id is untouchable,
but what about the creation?

notes and tags newly created will be saved with an autoincrement
and a boolean field that tell if they are saved or not.
when saving mongo should return us the new ID,
then the db will be updated.

a middleware level will need to check which operations will be done
and in which order.

warning:
when parsing a note from JSON which is a notefull, just get only what is needed.
Maybe I should add explicit cast?
